### Vault Sections

Documents are organized into sections:

- PERSONAL_MASTER (Authority: 100)
- AADHAAR_SECTION (Authority: 95)
- PASSPORT_SECTION (Authority: 90)
- PAN_SECTION (Authority: 85)
- EDUCATION (Authority: 70)

### Autofill

Intelligent suggestions when filling forms based on vault data

### Conflict Resolution

When field values conflict, they're tracked as "ambiguities" for manual resolution
